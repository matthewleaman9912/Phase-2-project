# Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the Pixar Collaboration! This README.md file will walk through all of the features, CSS choices, and images used throughout this project. Also, this file will describe the each page within this project and all of their individual abilities. At the end, there will also be a link to the video example of the use of this app followed by a brief description! This app will hopefully answer any and every question there is about pixar films, shorts, leadership and fun facts!

This application uses JavaScript, JavaScript React, and CSS to create a database of information about the different pieces of Pixar's wonderful company. This application allows the user to access features such as:
            * Access each movie Pixar has created and learn about its release date, characters and a simple image of the movie.
            * Access each short film with a simple image of the film, along with a brief summary of the short from the press of a button.
            * A view of each executive in the Pixar company, along with their position in the company and what branch of the company they work in.
            * Lastly, a form containing a few fun facts about pixar, along with a form where you can submit your very own Pixar fun fact!
